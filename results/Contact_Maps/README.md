# Results

Processed data output from the analysis scripts.

Each folder contains the output from the analysis scripts as run on each of the simulations, as well as the notebook used to plot them. The outputs from the notebooks should be the same figures as what are found in the figures folder.

Plotting of results and data processing is typically handled in Jupyter Notebooks.

Required Python modules:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- statistics
- pymbar
- math
