# Hydrogen Bonds of Mutation Sites

These are the outputs from cpptraj for average hydrogen bonds, sieved to mutation targets. The notebook "sieving.ipynb" was written to assist in narrowing down hydrogen bonds with mutation targets from files containing all hydrogen bonding pairs. Additionally, hydrogen bonds below 10% occupancy were ignored.
